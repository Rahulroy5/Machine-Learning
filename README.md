# Machine-Learning
Welcome to the "Introduction to Machine Learning" project! This project provides a comprehensive guide for beginners to learn the basics of machine learning using Python. We will cover fundamental concepts, basic mathematics, and practical implementations using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The project also includes an assignment focused on predicting house prices using regression techniques.
Libraries and Tools
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn: For data visualization.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and charts.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Project Components
Basic Mathematics
The project covers essential mathematical concepts required for understanding and implementing machine learning algorithms, including:

Algebra
Statistics
Calculus
Regression Analysis
Regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, we will use regression to predict house prices.

House Price Prediction Assignment
The main assignment involves predicting the price of a house based on various features. The steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize and understand the data.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.
Model Training: Training a regression model using Scikit-learn.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
Prediction: Making predictions on both training and test data and evaluating the results.
